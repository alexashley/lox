- Pick an open source implementation of a language you like. Download the source code and poke around in it. Try to find the code that implements the scanner and parser. Are they hand-written, or generated using tools like Lex and Yacc? (.l or .y files usually imply the latter.)
	- Kotlin. 
		- [Scanner/lexer is generated by JFlex (wrapped by some JetBrains tooling)](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/compiler/psi/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/lexer)
		- Couldn't pinpoint the parser but some of the front-end looks generated
- Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement a dynamically-typed language, but not all of them use it. What reasons are there to not JIT?
	- Simpler implementation
	- Slow start-up
- Most Lisp implementations that compile to C also contain an interpreter that lets them execute Lisp code on the fly as well. Why?
	- Provide a REPL for programmer enjoyment
	- Generate and execute Lua from C
